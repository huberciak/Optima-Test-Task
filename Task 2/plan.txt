My room renovation plan.

Room dimensions: 6.5m x 4m x 3m

Required materials: 
1. 40l of white wall paint
2. two packs of painting tape
3. protecting foil
4. two paint rollers
5. paintbrush
6. varnish for wood

Furniture to get rid of: 
1. bookstand
2. wardrobe

Furniture to buy: 
1. shoe rack
2. wardrobe
3. table lamp

Other things to buy:
1. extension cord
2. Ethernet cable
3. router
4. mattress
5. LED tape

The schedule:
1. Remove every electronic thing from the room.
2. Remove the bookstand and the wardrobe.
3. Switch off the electricity.
4. Tape power plugs and windows.
5. Protect furniture and the floor with foil.
6. Paint walls a couple of times. The paint should cover the old color completely. Painting and drying up will take some time. I suggest assembling furniture during this time (the shoe rack and wardrobe).
7. Varnish the most damaged parts of the floor.
8. When the floor and the walls are dry, set up furniture in the correct places.
9. Remove protecting foil and tape â€” clean the whole room.
10. Change the router and the table lamp.
11. Stick the LED tape to the ceiling. 

Congratulations, the room renovation is completed!
